# üé¨ Hybrid Content-Based Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment-Aware Re-Ranking

This project is a **hybrid content-based movie recommender system** that calculates similarity across **plot, genre, metadata, and user reviews**, then re-ranks the top recommendations based on **audience sentiment** from user reviews.

Unlike traditional recommenders that only use plot or genre similarity, our system:
- Extracts **semantic embeddings** of plot and reviews using **Sentence-BERT**.
- Computes **genre similarity** with **Jaccard Similarity**.
- Processes **cast, crew, and keywords** using **TF-IDF**.
- Combines similarities using **weighted sum**.
- Enhances recommendations by incorporating **Logistic Regression sentiment classification** for re-ranking.
